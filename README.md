# Makaira-Storefront with Remix!

This is a proof of concept to implement Makaira together with Remix.

The design is based on this [Themeforst Design](https://themeforest.net/item/unero-minimal-ecommerce-psd-template/19602508), so don't use this design in production.

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!
